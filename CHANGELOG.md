# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based roughly on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project does _not_ adhere to semantic versioning—it's a consumer
app.

## [Unreleased]

  scrollbars are configured to always show)

- (Firefox) Made the lookup puck handle taps and double-taps correctly on
  Firefox for Android.

  the popup _and_ expanding it.

  (e.g. ふいんき is dimmed when looking up 雰囲気)
  ([#877](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/877)).

- Made the name preview not show the age for a name entry when only a year is
  given, or when the name is not for a person
  ([#863](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/863)).
- Stopped the add-on from interfering with generic XML documents
  ([#902](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/902)).
- Stopped producing source maps for Safari and Chromium releases since they
  have trouble loading source maps from extension URLs producing an annoying
  message in the Javascript console in Chrome

  ([#782](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/782)).
- Ignores zero-width non-joiner characters (which Google Docs sometimes likes to
  put between characters).
- Handles `-webkit-user-select: none` content (such as
  [bookwalker.jp](https://bookwalker.jp)'s popup window) on Safari better
  ([#773](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/773)).

- Fixed a regression where non-Firefox browsers could not look up the first

  ([#687](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/687)).

  四畳半, 6.5帖, 10㎡, or 十二平米

- (Re-)added an option to show only kanji entries by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>
  ([#650](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/650)).

  This behavior must be explicitly enabled from the settings page.
  However, it should now work without requiring the "Hold to show pop-up" feature.

- Made the shortcut key to toggle the extension on and off no longer be
  synchronized so that the full range of modified keys can be used and so that
  extensions keys configured via the browser UI interoperate with the extension
  UI better
  ([#652](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/652)).

- Made the popup not show up so eagerly when the hold-to-show key(s) is/are
  pressed and a text box is focussed since it can interfere with copying and
  pasting
  ([#651](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/651)).

- Optimized searching for variants of 長音 (ー) and 旧字体 to perform fewer
  lookups while considering all 長音 variations for name entries.

- Defined an additional key that can be configured to switch dictionaries,
  <kbd>n</kbd>, since <kbd>Shift</kbd> can be unavailable when Firefox's
  resist fingerprinting mode is enabled.

  data is being updated.

  types, dialects etc.)

  ([#605](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/605))

  ([#577](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/577))

## [0.4.0] - 2021-04-08

- Switched to using IndexedDB database for looking up words

  - **Non-English definitions are now supported**
  - Rikaichamp now uses much less memory
  - All dictionaries are automatically updated weekly by downloading
    just the changed entries
  - While the words dictionary is being downloaded or updated, or in
    case there is an error applying it (e.g. lack of disk space)
    a fallback English dictionary is used.

    Users who encounter errors due to lack of disk space are encouraged
    to uninstall and re-install the add-on. That _might_ resolve the
    issue.

- Various fixes were added the order in which entries are displayed.

  Ideographs Extension B so that some more rare kanji are recognized.

## [0.3.5] - 2021-03-19

  digits (e.g. 令和七九年 instead of 令和七十九年)
  thanks to [@SaltfishAmi](https://github.com/SaltfishAmi)
- Moved Rikaichamp popup to an isolated shadow DOM tree so that it should
  be more robust when used on pages that set styles in ways that conflict
  with Rikaichamp's styles
  ([#144](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/issues/144))
