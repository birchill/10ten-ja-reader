     browser.runtime) _and_ a content script (since we inject the content

<h1 class=text-center>Rikaichamp is now
<span class=sm:whitespace-nowrap>10ten Japanese Reader!</span></h1>

<aside class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-800">
<span class="font-bold">Note:</span>
Some people have experienced problems after updating to the latest version where
the popup doesn't appear to show on most pages.
If this happens, please try restarting your browser.
It should work after that.
We're really really sorry for the inconvenience. 🙇
</aside>

<section id=what-happenned>
<h2>What happened to Rikaichamp?</h2>
<p>
We're working on a couple of side projects and while they're still a few
months or more away from being ready,
we thought it would make sense to put them all under the same 10ten
(&ldquo;ten-ten&rdquo;) name sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
Rest assured though, it's just a change in name.
10ten Japanese Reader is fundamentally the same and
continues to be free and open source.
</p>

<aside id=what-meaning>
<h3>What does 10ten mean anyway?</h3>
<p>
10ten (&ldquo;ten-ten&rdquo;) alludes to the importance of playing with words when you learn
a language, finding connections in unlikely places like the English pronunciation
of the number 10 and the Japanese word for &ldquo;dot&rdquo; (<span lang=ja>点</span>).
You might even say it's a <span lang=ja>重点</span> = <span lang=ja>じゅうてん</span> = 10-ten!
</p>
<p>
10ten also hints at the Japanese pronunciation of &hellip; ("ten ten ten")
suggesting the open-ended possibilities that come from mastering another language.
</p>
<p>
Finally, 10ten is derived from <span lang=ja>天才</span> (the previous working
title was actually 10sai) because we believe <em>everyone</em> has a God-given
(<span lang=ja>天</span>) ability (<span lang=ja>才</span>)
to learn and speak another language.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the name, we hope 10ten Japanese Reader will be a helpful tool as you
use Japanese (or English as the case may be!).
</p>
</aside>
</section>

<section id="new-look">
<h2>New look</h2>

<p>
As part of rebranding we've added a new theme inspired by the typesetting in
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/1568364075/" rel=noopener>The Kodansha Kanji
Learner's Dictionary</a> that we hope is a little easier to look at.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src=img/kodansha-theme.png alt="Screenshot of the new default theme showing
    the result of looking up the kanji character 点."
    style="width: 521.3333px" class=mx-auto>
  <figcaption class=text-center>The new default theme.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The default theme also respects your computer's dark mode settings,
switching to the black theme as needed.
The other themes are still there, though, if you still want to use them.
We've tweaked the colors a little to make them a little less garish, however.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src=img/theme-selection.png alt="Screenshot of the theme selection panel
    showing the new default theme and the existing themes."
    style="width: 485.3333px" class=mx-auto>
  <figcaption class=text-center>You can change themes from the <a href="#"
  class="options-link">options page</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
We're also gradually making 10ten Japanese Reader work better on touch-screen
devices.
This release includes tabs across the top so you can see which dictionaries have
results, and if you're on a touch screen device you can tap the tabs.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src=img/tab-size.png alt="Two screenshots overload comparing the size of tabs
    on a regular display compared to a touch screen device where they are larger."
    style="width: 635.3333px" class=mx-auto>
  <figcaption class=text-center>Regular tabs versus touch screen tabs.</figcaption>

<section id="new-features">
<h2>New features</h2>
<p>
Ever tried searching for an apartment in Japan and been confused by <span
lang=ja>畳</span>?
Or maybe you know <span lang=ja>畳</span> but have trouble converting that to square metres for
others?
</p>
<p>
10ten Japanese Reader now automatically converts between <span lang=ja>畳</span> and
<span lang=ja>平方メートル</span> and back.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src=img/area-conversion.png alt="Screenshot showing the result of converting
    4.5畳 to 7.29 square meters."
    style="width: 514.6667px" class=mx-auto>
  <figcaption class=text-center>Converting from 四畳半 to square meters.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Try it out here ↓
</p>
<ul>
<li lang=ja>6畳</li>
<li lang=ja>四畳半</li>
<li lang=ja>1.5 帖</li>
<li>6m<sup>2</sup></li>
<li lang=ja>22.5平米</li>
<li lang=ja>7.29平㍍</li>
</ul>

<aside class="did-you-know">
<h4>Did you know?</h4>
<p>
The size of a standard tatami mat varies from region to region.
The only requirement is that for real estate listings using <span lang=ja>畳</span>,
<span lang=ja>1畳</span> must be
<em>at least</em> 1.62 square meters.
However, when using the <span lang=ja>帖</span> kanji, <span lang=ja>1帖</span> is
defined as being <em>exactly</em> 1.62m<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Don't worry though, 10ten has your back. It will show you conversions for common sizes
unless you're looking at a <span lang=ja>帖</span> measure, in which case it will
just show you the one true value.
</p>
</aside>

<p class="let-us-know">
Are there other Japanese measurements you would like converted?

or
<a href="https://twitter.com/10tenstudy" rel=noopener>Twitter (@10tenstudy)</a>.
</p>

<p>
We've also added a few more keyboard settings in this release so check out the
<a href="#" class="options-link">options page</a> if you're interested.

<h2>New platforms</h2>
<p>
In addition to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/10ten-ja-reader/"
rel=noopener>Firefox</a>, we've been available on
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pnmaklegiibbioifkmfkgpfnmdehdfan" rel=noopener>Chrome</a>
and
<a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cgiogkjpebgfcpcaipiicfeaelpapeig" rel=noopener>Edge</a> for a few months now,
but we recently also added support for
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/10ten-japanese-reader/id1573540634" rel=noopener>Safari</a> too.
<em>(Note that each extension store takes a different amount of time to update
so some of the links here might still display information about an old version
of Rikaichamp.)</em>
</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/10ten-japanese-reader/id1573540634" rel=noopener><img
    src=img/app-store-mac.png alt="Screenshot showing App Store listing for 10ten
    Japanese reader."
    style="width: 412px" class="mx-auto"></a>
  <figcaption class=text-center>10ten Japanese Reader is in the App Store.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The Safari version of 10ten Japanese Reader takes a slightly different approach
to other versions.
When using 10ten Japanese reader on Safari you will need to explicitly
enable it on each site where you want to look something up
(e.g. by pressing <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>).
This has the advantage that you don't need to grant 10ten Japanese Reader permissions
when you install it.
Furthermore, you can be absolutely certain that it won't snoop on you
(it doesn't, of course, but this way you can let your browser enforce that).
</p>
<p>
Depending on how successful this is, we might try to bring this to other platforms
in future.
We'd be interested in knowing your thoughts about this over in <a
href="https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/discussions"
rel=noopener>GitHub discussions</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/10tenstudy" rel=noopener>Twitter (@10tenstudy)</a>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="what-is-this-page">
<h2>Why am I seeing this page anyway?</h2>
<p>
This page is automatically displayed the first time you update from
Rikaichamp to 10ten Japanese Reader.
It won't be displayed again on this device.
</p>
<p>
We don't plan on bothering you with pages like this often unless there's a
particularly important change.
If these pages become more frequent we'll add a way to turn them off.
10ten Japanese Reader is supposed to help you, not distract you!
</p>
