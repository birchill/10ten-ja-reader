Hi!

Thank you so much for offering to contribute! Here are a few tips that might help.

# Things to keep in mind

- Quality over features. Your code doesn't need to be great (we'll work on it
  together) but we're generally more interested in fixing the basics (faster,
  more robust, more accurate lookups etc.) than adding half-baked features.
  When we add a feature, we like to do it properly.

- Options are a refuge for the indecisive ðŸ˜…. It's tempting to hedge your bets
  and "just add an option" but we try to avoid that when possible. It makes the
  extension harder to maintain and most users will never discover the option.
  Instead it's worth working out if there's a different approach that will work
  well for (nearly) everyone. So far we've been pretty successful at doing that.

# Development

## Checking out

If you have the [`gh` CLI tool](https://cli.github.com/) installed,
you can fork and clone in one command:

```
gh repo fork birchill/10ten-ja-reader --clone=true
```

However, because we store snapshots of the dictionary data in the repository, it
might take a while so you might prefer a
[blobless clone](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/):

```
gh repo fork birchill/10ten-ja-reader
git clone --filter=blob:none birchill/10ten-ja-reader
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

## Building

To build the Firefox version:

```
yarn build:firefox
```

The output should be in the `dist-firefox` folder.

Similarly you can use `yarn build:chrome`, `yarn build:edge`, `yarn
build:thunderbird` to build the Chrome, Edge, and Thunderbird versions.
The output will be in the `dist-chrome`, `dist-edge`, `dist-thunderbird` folders
respectively.

To build and package up a zip:

```
yarn package:firefox # or yarn package:chrome, yarn package:edge etc.
```

### Building on Safari

First run:

```
yarn build:safari
```

Then open Xcode and choose the `.xcodeproj` under `xcode13`.
You will need to select the target platform (iOS vs Mac) to build.

## Running

For manual testing you can use:

```
yarn start:firefox # or yarn start:chrome
```

This will run the app using the webpack runner in Firefox (or Chrome) with
automatic reloading.

To run a specific version of Firefox:

```
yarn start:firefox --env firefox=nightly
```

Other options include:

- `--env firefoxProfile=<path>`,
- `--env chromium=<path>`,
- `--env chromeProfile=<path>`,
- `--env keepProfileChanges`, and
- `--env profileCreateIfMissing`.

(I believe the latter two options only apply to Firefox.)

### Firefox for Android

Instructions are [here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/developing-extensions-for-firefox-for-android/).

Once you've set up `adb` correctly and got the device ID, you should be able to run:

```
yarn web-ext run -t firefox-android --adb-device <device ID> --firefox-apk org.mozilla.fenix
```

That will use the version of `web-ext` installed by this project.

### Safari

As with the build instructions above, after running `yarn build:safari` you
should be able to run using Xcode.

## Testing

```
yarn test
```

Unit tests only:

```
yarn test:unit
```

Browser-based tests only:

```
yarn test:firefox
yarn test:chromium
```

Running a single browser-based test in watch mode:

```
npx playwright-test tests/get-text.test.ts --browser firefox --watch
```

Unfortunately [`playwright-test`](https://github.com/hugomrdias/playwright-test)
doesn't currently seem to let you configure multiple browsers to run at once.

[`@web/test-runner`](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) does but
it is less diligent about updating the version of Playwright meaning you end up
testing old browsers.

## Releasing

Pre-release checks:

- If we've made changes to the build setup at all, it's good to run
  `yarn zip-src` and verify that the generated zip file can actually be used to
  build the add-on for Firefox.

  Otherwise the submission will likely be rejected from AMO.

- It's also good to check that the release notes are being parsed correctly by
  running `yarn tsx scripts/release-notes.js`.

We trigger releases by running the release workflow from
[Actions](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader/actions/workflows/release.yml).

That will create a draft release that you need to publish before anything gets
uploaded.

If you need to test the release process locally, you can use:

```
yarn release --dry-run -V
```

After publishing the release, it should automatically be uploaded to AMO
(Firefox) and the Edge Store but we need to manually upload it to the Chrome Web
Store and Thunderbird add-ons site.

### Releasing on Safari

Releasing for Safari needs to be done on a Mac.

First run:

```
# git pull & yarn install etc.
#
# NOTE: Make sure we've updated version by publishing a release (see above)
# first.
yarn build:safari
```

Then:

1. Open Xcode.
1. Select the target: Mac or iOS. You eventually need to do both.
   For iOS, you need to set the device to "Any iOS Device" in order to generate
   a suitable build.
1. Run Product â†’ Archive.
1. Choose Distribute App.
1. App Store Connect.
1. Upload.

If you get `No Accounts with "App Store Connect" Access for team` at this point
restarting Xcode should fix it.

1. (Default options for the next couple of dialogs.)
1. Upload (again).

If that succeeds then it's time to update the App Store.

Note that it will take several minutes to process the uploaded build so there's
no hurry.

1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps and choose 10ten Japanese Reader
1. Choose the MacOS/iOS app and copy the Promotional Text.
1. Press the blue + next to the macOS/iOS App and enter the new version number
1. Fill out the changes field / promotional text and save
   (If it ever fails to save because, e.g. you entered a disallowed character,
   you lose all your work so save regularly.)
1. Select the uploaded build. It can take a few minutes to be processed after
   which you'll need to reload the page to see it.
   You can check the status of processing the build from the TestFlight tab.

After that is done, you'll need to do the same for the iOS/MacOS build depending
on which one you did first.
