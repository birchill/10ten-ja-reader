the information collected here directly into 10ten, making it as accessible as possible
for everyone.

## 📋 To-Do

Out first goal is to create an article for each deinflection reason listed in the
`Reason` enum from `src/background/deinflect.ts`. These articles will be made accessible
alongside the deinflection chain displayed when viewing an inflected word entry.

Each article should provide detailed explanations covering the following points:

1. **The Auxiliary Word:**
   Name the auxiliary word, e.g ない, たい, すぎる.
2. **Stem Attachment:**
   The type of stem the auxiliary word attaches to, e.g i-stem / masu-stem / 連用形,
   a-stem / irrealis stem / 未然形.
3. **Function in Context:**
   Clarify the role or function of the auxiliary word in the specific grammatical
   or contextual usage.
4. **General Meaning:**
   If appropriate, provide a broader overview of the auxiliary word’s general meaning
   and usage across contexts.
